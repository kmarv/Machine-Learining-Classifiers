# machine learining classifiers algorithms
 diffretn fiile contain the diffirent machine learning classifier algorithm which include logistic classifier , support vector machine classfier, K-NN algorthm, random forest classifer, decsion tree classifier, naive bayes algorithm. all these algorithms are used on a data set position which  contains 3 columns (age , salry and purchased.. predictions have been carried out using the different algorithms to predict who will or willnot  purchase an SUV vehicle based on thier age and salary
