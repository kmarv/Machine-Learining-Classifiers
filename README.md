# machine learining classifiers algorithms
 different py files contain the diffirent machine learning classifier algorithms which include logistic classifier , support vector machine classfier, K-NN algorthm, random forest classifer, decsion tree classifier, naive bayes algorithm. All these algorithms are used on a data set (position.csv) which  contains 3 columns (age , salry and purchased.. Predictions have been carried out using the different algorithms to predict who will or willnot  purchase an SUV vehicle based on thier age and salary
